# cpptoolbox
My C++ utilities library with some common C++ constructs I'm using. The goal is to keep it small and header only. Currently the library consists of several "modules":

## argv
Command line argument parsing (getopt wrapper)

## cpp
Some common C++ helpers related only to language and standard library

## curl
libcurl C++ wrapper inspired by libcurlpp providing only small subset of functionalities

## gcc
gcc related stuff
